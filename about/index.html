		<h2>Moi</h2>

		<p>Hey, my name is Jonah. Online, you can find me under "geremachek" or "gmk". 
		I'm an eccentric hobbyist programmer and student. I am mostly interested in anthropology, linux, and minimalist software.<p>

		<p>I've been a member of the *nix community since 2017, when I dual booted ubuntu on my Windows machine. From there I eventually installed Linux Mint on my laptop, then Manjaro, and now Arch. I run a <a href="https://geremachek.io/blog">blog</a> but I post very rarely. You can also find my software on this site, but you'll have better luck on my <a href="http://github.com/geremachek">GitHub</a> if you want more detailed information about it. I mainly write minmalist software that helps me acomplish tasks in the way <i>I</i> want to accomplish them. Oh and everything I write is GPL because praise Stallman</p>

		<p>I'm also interested in cats, ancient history, lingustics, writing and numeral systems, fantasy, fountain pens, and mechanical pencils, among other things.</p>
		<br><br>

		<h2>This site</h2>

		<p>This site is just basic html with a single universal stylesheet. I don't use any fancy blogging software or anything like that, I just create and link text files, Currently I'm using Github Pages to host the site but I'll probably rent a server at somepoint</p>
