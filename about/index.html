		<p>
		Hey, my name is Jonah Rongstad. Online, you can find me under "geremachek" or "gmk". I'm a hobbyist programmer and student. I mostly interested in back-end, linux, and minimalist software. I've been a member of the *nix community since 2017, when I dual booted ubuntu on my Windows machine. From there I eventually installed Linux Mint on my laptop, then Manjaro, and now Arch. I run a <a href "../blog">blog</a> but I post very rarely. You can also find my software on this site, but you'll have better luck on my <a href="http://github.com/geremachek">GitHub</a> if you want more detailed information about it. I mainly write minmalist software that helps me acomplish tasks in the way <i>I</i> want to accomplish them. Oh and everything I write is GPL because praise Stallman
