		<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

		<p>The Ge&#701;ez script is an abugida which is used to write several languages in the Ethiopian-Eritrean region of Africa. It is significant for its use to write the (now) liturgical Ge&#701;ez language from which it gets its name. You can read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%CA%BDez_script">here</a>.

		<p>Ge&#701;ez is an abugida which means that words are formed by groupings of consonant-vowel units. Each symbol, usually, represents a consonant and a vowel. However, the feature of an abugida that distinguishes it from a syllabary or the like is that the syllable clusters are formed from a single consonant "root" that is modified with diacritics or the like denote vowels. If you read Hebrew or Arabic, this idea should be familiar to you given that Ge&#701;ez, an another Semitic language was originally written using and abjad, a similar style of writing system that both of those aforementioned languages use to this day.</p>
