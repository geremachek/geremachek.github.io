Good afternoon!

I finally got around to revamping my website, and I have to say that I'm quite happy with it. I've once again restarted the blog.
This time, in order to make it as convenient as possible to make frequent posts, I'm just going to have blog posts be plain text files.

In recent months I've started to learn ancient greek, it's been a fun hobby that keeps me busy. I've really enjoyed it so far...
I've also started to learn the Haskell programming language, I'm learning it through the "Learn you a Haskell" eBook, and I really am drawn to some of its features.
Who knows? Maybe it will take Go's place as my favorite programming language.
