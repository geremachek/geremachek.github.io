Merlin!

After a lot of work, I have finally finished the text editor. It has been a long time coming, and I'm glad I was able to see it through.
It turned out a lot differently than I had originally planned, the best way I could describe it is as a mix between the sam editor, and the forth programming language. Yes, that weird
There are no docs yet, and I am still considering a visual component of some kind. It is quite useable in its current state though, although it has a very steep learning curve.
Anyway, there will most likely still be some changes made and some companion programs written, yet still Merlin, in all of its raw beauty and esoteria, is here.

Oh and of course this blog post was written entirely inside of Merlin :)
