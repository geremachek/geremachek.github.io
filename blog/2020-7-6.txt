Upcoming projects

Recently I've had quite a few ideas for some programs. I'd like to finish some by the end of the summer, but knowing myself, I doubt I will.

I've started working on a pixel art editor that exports and reads ppm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm) files. It really isn't something that will be all that useful,
just something for me to muck about in when I'm bored. Also, it will be useful when designing sprites fora Argonaut (https://github.com/playargonaut/)

I also plan to write a companion program that reads pbm, pgm, and ppm files and displays them with ANSI color formatting. I think I'm going to write this in
Haskell for practice.

Because I'm learning ancient greek and I love strange writing systems, I had an idea for a program that would accept input from a user and display it back to them in the 
writing system  of their choosing. The program would also accept input from stdin, a file, or command-line arguments. The displayed character would chorespond to the key 
pressed by the user

So that:
	a -> α
	b -> β
	g -> γ

Finally I'd like to create a simple music player that isn't based on anything like mpd. It would take an mp3 file or a directory of mp3s and play them. The user to start/stop
tracks, move back and forth between tracks, and shuffle. I would build it over my tinyscr library and it would only show the user information on a single line, making sure everything
is as minimal as possible.
