Meditations on Undershirts in Film

Since my interest in fashion began, I have paid close attention to the use of clothing in film, both to develop my own taste and to greaten my understanding of the "mechanics" of
fashion. In my own definition "fashion mechanics" refer to the ways in which clothes are worn and matched to create a cohesive and logical whole.

One of the mechanics, or "fashion rules", that stood out to me, by virtue of varied following both within film and real life, was the wearing of undershirts under collared shirts. 
Undershirts, by definition, are designed to be worn underneath dress shirts, yet it is not an uncommon occurance that these shirts are worn without any sort of protective garment.
This variability, both in type of undershirt and use of the garment at all, gives the film-maker an easy short-hand to inform the viewer about a character.

An almost perfect depiction of the archetypal "t-shirt style undergarment wearer" might be Dwight Schrute from the NBC sitcom "The Office" Schrute's commitment to rules, authority, and
hierarchy is communicated well through his commitment to wearing undershirts underneath his short-sleeved dress shirts throughout the series.
