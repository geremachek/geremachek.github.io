The Text Editor

I have always wanted to right my own text editor. I have started numerous times, but then eventually stopped.
At the beginning of this year, I started again. I got quite far, I implemented a fully featured screen editor, but again, I stopped.

I have again started, but with a different outlook. I have decided to not write a screen editor at all. I have decided to write a an editor that is more similar to that of ed or sam.
Instead of a visual document, the user will interact with the editor in a shell like-envrioment, using a command language with syntax comparable to LISP. There will be a focus on using
external commands and programs to process text, such as sed and awk. Merlin, as I have chosen to call it, will simply act as an interface for those programs, and provide internal
commands and features to make text editing/processing easier.

As I don't have to implement a screen, editor, merlin shouldn't take too long to develop, it should be done by the end of the year.

Anyways, cheers.
