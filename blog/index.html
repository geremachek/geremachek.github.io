				<b>3/15/19 - Wrting a Python Curses Program</b>
				<br>
				Python is a great option is you want to create a simple, or complex tui program. The most notable python tui I've written so far has been <a href="https://github.com/geremachek/pluto">pluto</a>. When I started writing pluto I had virtually no curses experience. Because of this, I wrote very sloppy and bug-prone code. Whenever I tried to add a new feature, I would have to spend an hour or so debugging to get the feature working properly. So I decided to rewrite from scratch. This really helped me actually <i>learn</i> curses, and create a usable program.

				This is my first post here. I hope I'm able to post regularly as writing about what I'm doing helps to keep me on task. My other blogs have usually dried up after three or four months of infrequent posting.
