				<b>12/30/19 - CATFM is here!</b>
				<br>
				As promised, I have rewritten pluto. catfm, or cool and technical file manager is, at least in my very one sided opinion, one of the best text mode file managers for Unix-like systems. It uses that suckless style of source configuring that allows the user to program in their own features and build their own personal "distrobution" of the program. The user can map almost any key to almost any funcion/script imaginable. I mainly built catfm for myself, so the documentation provided in the <code>config.go</code> is lacking. Still, I hope you can get some enjoyment out of it and I hope you like using it as much as I like working on it.

				<b>9/2/19 - I'm back!</b>
				<br>
				I'm back! I've actually done quite a lot since my last post 5 months ago, I finished the organizer program, deprecated pluto, abandoned python, and created quite a few cool pieces of software. But the most important thing that I did, today actually, was move all of my projects to git! Although I've used GitHub since 2016, I would always upload files directly to the website, not through git, this is shown through all of the "Added files through upload" commit messages. This process made maintaining a blog much more difficult than it had to be as I needed to open a browser everytime I wanted to update the blog. Moving on to a more interesting topic, the deprecation of pluto, why did I do it? Python. Python was my favorite language for a while, as It was the only language I knew, but as I became more computer/programming savvy, I began to notice a cripling issue with python, speed. That's how I fell in love with go, it's pretty fast, C like, and had a syntax that just felt <i>right</i> to me. Now whenever I try to program in any other language, I often find myselft typing <code>fmt.Println()</code> or <code>func main()</code>.  This new love of go made working on any python project very difficult for me so I abandoned pluto, and python its self. I will be releasing a spiritual successor to pluto in a few days that <i>is</i> written in go.

				<b>4/9/19 - Barrel O' Projects</b>
				<br>
				Well, it hasn't been a whole month yet. I pretty much failed in plan to post every two days. From now on I'm going to try to post every Friday. Anyway, in the past month I've discovered I have a problem with projects. I'm a kind of a absent minded person, so when I'm out and about in life, I often think of ideas for programs, etc. Because of this I often come up with a bit to many project ideas. I have about 5 or so projects that I have had in the back of my head for six months that I have made zero progress on. More recently I've started to put all these ideas in a file in my <b>/home</b> directory. I don't use a "to do" list program because, funnily enough, one of my ideas is a to do list like program. I'm hoping to get the project I'm focusing on right now released by the end of this week. Hopefully I'm able to keep on schedule!

				<b>3/18/19 - The Mythical UNIX "booker"</b>
				<br>
				Most standard UNIX applications have been rewritten, and moderenized in that past ten or so years. The one program that hasn't, at least in my oppinon is the pager. You may not even know what a pager is, most *nix systems set less or more as the default <b>$PAGER</b>. You probably have used a pager, though. <b>man</b> pipes it's output into <b>$PAGER</b>. I really like the idea of a pager. An interactive program that allows you to quickly maneuver through a document without the risk of editing the document. This got me thinking, what if I took the idea of a pager, and optimized for reading books, or reading text streams like books. This is how I got the idea for the "booker", a pager like program that is optimized for reading. This "booker" would allow you to change margin size, character scrolling etc. It also would turn text into a "book" by segmenting each screenfull of text as a page, or by removing newline entirely and creating a "book" out of that. Allowing the user to highlight the current word, or line they are on would also make the program more favorable twoards reading.

				<b>3/15/19 - Wrting a Python Curses Program</b>
				<br>
				Python is a great option is you want to create a simple, or complex tui program. The most notable python tui I've written so far has been <a href="https://github.com/geremachek/pluto">pluto</a>. When I started writing pluto I had virtually no curses experience. Because of this, I wrote very sloppy and bug-prone code. Whenever I tried to add a new feature, I would have to spend an hour or so debugging to get the feature working properly. So I decided to rewrite from scratch. This really helped me actually <i>learn</i> curses, and create a usable program.

				<b>3/15/19 - Hello, World</b>
				<br>
				This is my first post here. I hope I'm able to post regularly as writing about what I'm doing helps to keep me on task. My other blogs have usually dried up after three or four months of infrequent posting.
