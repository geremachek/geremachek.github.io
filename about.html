		<h2>Moi</h2>

		<p>Hello, online you can find me under "geremachek" or "gmk". I'm an eccentric hobbyist programmer and student. I am mostly interested in anthropology, linguistics, Linux, and minimalist software.<p>

		<p>I spend most of my time programming, learning a new language (currently Attic Greek and Ancient Egyptian), listening to folk music, or reading.</p>

		<p>I'm also interested in cats, ancient history, writing systems, fantasy, fountain pens, mechanical pencils, among other things.</p>

		<br><br>

		<h2>This site</h2>

		<p>This site is just basic HTML with a single universal stylesheet. I don't use any fancy blogging software or anything like that, I just create and link text files, Currently I'm using Github Pages to host the site but I'll probably rent a server at some point.</p>
