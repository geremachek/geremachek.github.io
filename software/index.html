			<br>
			catfm is the direct successor to the pluto file manager I started working on in mid 2017. Lunae share a lot of basic design ideas with pluto (extreme customizabiliy, simplicity, etc). The main difference is that catfm is written in Go, not Python, and is more feature rich and polished. It also takes the suckless approach of not having a config file and forcing the user to edit a <code>config.h</code> (in this case <code>config.go</code>) file in order to customize the program.

			<br>
			conch is a simple organizer/to do list program for the terminal. Unlike many other similar programs, the grouping function is recursive and can hold other groups aswell as items. Think of this like directories on your computer. Another notable feature is the abillity to create custom "tags". A tag is a symbol or some text of a certain color displayed next to an item, the benefit of having custom tags and not just "done" and "unfinished" tags is that you can convey more detail and information about the state of the item through the tag. For more information, check out the GitHub page.

			<br>
			I created przm because I hated having to open a browser just to use a color picker. Being a cli/tui guru, I created a simple command that allowed me to mess with colors using the ubiquitous vi style key-bindings

			<br>
			graf is simple CLI data grapher, as you may pick up from the name. graf takes numerical data and converts it into a colorful graph or percent bar. graf also has options that allow you to tweak the bars size if it is two small (it probably is by default!) or two big. Documention/source is on the GitHub page
